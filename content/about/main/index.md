intro: |
  I am currently pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics and an MBA in Global Business from the University of Newcastle, with my graduation on the horizon. My academic journey has ignited a deep passion for data analysis and honed my technical skills across tools like SQL, Power BI, and Advanced Excel.
  
  Beyond the realm of data and analytics, I am an Astrophile, a fitness fnatic, and a coffe lover. I cherish the vibrant experiences Australia offers, which I currently call home. I am a team player and easy-going individual, always eager to embrace new complex challenges and contribute positively to a dynamic team environment.
  
  As I approach graduation, I am excited to find opportunities in the industry where I can leverage my skills and dedication to make a meaningful impact. If you’re looking for a passionate team player ready to learn and grow, let’s connect!
