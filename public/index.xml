The dashboard provides insights into revenue, sales quantity by markets, revenue trends, top customers, and top products.&#xA;Although this is a fundamental project that involves fetching data from a SQL server, it has been an invaluable learning experience for me as a beginner in data analysis. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of advanced SQL queries and learned how to create an interactive and beautiful Power BI dashboard.</description>

      <description>Rendering mathematical equations Examples from the mathjax demo. But they work with katex as well.&#xA;Rmarkdown In .Rmarkdown documents, you can use either&#xA;$a \ne 0$ to get inline math: \(a \ne 0\).
